### ðŸ“± Speedometer
**Description:** I developed a custom speedometer UI programmatically using CAShapeLayer to create the circular design, along with CAGradientLayer for a smooth gradient effect. The animation is handled using CABasicAnimation, ensuring a dynamic and visually appealing transition when the speed changes.

**Tech Used:**
- Custom Circular UI: Built using CAShapeLayer to define the arc and speed indicator
- Gradient Effect: Applied with CAGradientLayer for a polished look
- Smooth Animations: Implemented using CABasicAnimation to update the speed dynamically
- Performance Optimized: Efficient rendering without excessive CPU/GPU load
