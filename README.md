## 📂 Projects
Here are some of my featured projects. Click on each project for more details.

### 🏦 BankCore (Secure FinTech Demo)
**Description:** A proof-of-concept iOS framework designed to demonstrate **Secure DevSecOps** practices. While the banking logic is simplified for demonstration purposes, the surrounding infrastructure implements a production-grade security pipeline standard in modern FinTech environments.

**Key Skills Demonstrated:**
* **DevSecOps Architecture:** Built a fully automated GitHub Actions pipeline that blocks insecure code before it merges.
* **Supply Chain Security:** Integrated **Gitleaks** and **GitHub Push Protection** to prevent API key leaks.
* **Test Automation:** configured a **TDD workflow** that runs XCTest suites on an iPhone 16 Simulator in the cloud.
* **Release Engineering:** Managed Xcode Schemes and Targets to separate Test logic from Production builds.
